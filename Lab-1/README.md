### **Make sure to download data from link below before running any code**
The directories should be structured such that: `Data/Combined_Data/` and `Data/Trapezoid_Heights/` are both directories that exist within the `NE-204/Lab-1/` directory. Outside the Lab 1 directory, there should be a python file containing all the relevant imports and created functions for this course `NE204_Functions.py`

#### Operation of the code to generate figures
> **Usage:**
> <br />Open the `NE-204_Lab-1_Final-Code.ipynb` file in a Jupyter notebook environment with the Anaconda Navigator app or as below in a terminal:
>> `jupyter notebook NE-204_Lab-1_Final-Code.ipynb`
>
> This will open the notebook in a local webpage and allow for operation of the code.
>
> Make sure to run the first cell as it imports all the functions from the `NE204_Functions.py` file as well as some local variables defined within this file.
>
> From there operation should be as straightforward as running cells within sections to reproduce the plots shown within the cells.

As an important note, although these trapezoidal calculations are pretty fast (on the order of ~250iterations/sec on my laptop), I've included some pre-calculated trapezoid heights and also the same datasets but calibrated trapezoid heights. This will allow for fast importing of data to play with.
